                        <h2>About Lunar Eclipse</h2>
                        <br/>
                        <p>
                            In June 2020, I had one week off work with one goal: write and record a piece of instrumental music. Lunar Eclipse is the result.
                        </p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>
                            Mariette Stephenson asked me to arrange Lunar Eclipse for the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/p/Kitchener-Waterloo-Guitar-Orchestra-100063293584053/">Kitchener-Waterloo Guitar Orchestra</a>. It was my first Classical Guitar Ensemble composition.
                        </p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>
                            I commissioned award-winning local Waterloo artist Moumita Roychowdhury to make art inspired by Lunar Eclipse. She listened and painted, and I cherish her series of incredible watercolour interpretations.
                        </p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>
                            I'm thrilled that Lunar Eclipse is available at <a href="https://guitarcurriculum.com">GuitarCurriculum.com</a>. Students all over the world can discover a rock piece for their classical guitars by a Bengali-Canadian composer.

                        <h2>About Hemlock Wave</h2>
                        <br/>
                        <p>
                            Luthier Steve Doreen of <a href="http://lonetreeguitars.com/">Lone Tree Guitars & Ukuleles</a> in British Columbia, Canada sold me his gorgeous fanned-fret Low-G ukulele, made from Western Hemlock. It is the best sounding instrument I own.
                        </p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>
                            It's a Hawaiian instrument made by a Canadian luthier with Canadian wood. I paid tribute to Hawaii with a strummed Ukulele soloist part. I paid tribute the progressive rock elements formative to my musical taste growing up in Canada, including shifting time signatures.
                        </p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>
                            Hemlock Wave was composed with a classical guitar ensemble trio format in mind, and the Ukulele is fun but optional - the Guitar 1 part can be played on Guitar (with capo) or Low-G Ukulele.
                        </p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>
                            Hemlock Wave was awarded 1st place the Adult 19+ Original Ensemble Composition category at the OMFA (<a href="https://omfa.ca/">Ontario Music Festivals Association</a>) 2024 Virtual Festival.

                        <br/>
                        <p>
                            I was reading a book to my children. Lyrics to an imaginary song filled the page. This is the melody I sang to my kids as I read.
                        </p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>
                            The ebbs and flows represent a journey through a marsh, getting closer and closer to the monster.
                        </p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>
                            You can expect to hear a phrase from The Two Grenadiers by Schumann. It's a piece from the Suzuki repertoire, and the decade or more of hearing it must have subconsciously informed the melody I sang to my kids. What better way to represent violent escalation in the search for a monster than the actual musical tone of soldiers, borrowed from Schumann.
